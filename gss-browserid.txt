 A SASL and GSS-API Mechanism for the BrowserID Authentication Protocol
                   draft-howard-gss-browserid-02.txt

Abstract

   This document defines protocols, procedures and conventions for a
   Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API)
   security mechanism based on the BrowserID authentication mechanism.
   Through the GS2 family of mechanisms defined in RFC 5801, these
   protocols also define how Simple Authentication and Security Layer
   (SASL, RFC 4422) applications may use BrowserID.

Internet-Draft          BrowserID SASL & GSS-API              April 2013


1.  Introduction

   [BrowserID] is a web-based three-party security protocol by which
   user agents can present to a Relying Party (RP) a signed assertion of
   e-mail address ownership.  BrowserID was intended to be used for web
   authentication.  We find BrowserID to be useful in general, therefore
   we define herein how to use it in many more applications.

   The Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) [RFC4422] is a
   framework for providing authentication and message protection
   services via pluggable mechanisms.  Protocols that support it include
   IMAP, SMTP, and XMPP.

   The Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API)
   [RFC2743] provides a framework for authentication and message
   protection services through a common programming interface.  This
   document conforms to the SASL and GSS-API bridge specified in
   [RFC5801], so it defines both a SASL and GSS-API mechanism.

   The BrowserID mechanism described in this document reuses the
   existing web-based BrowserID protocol, but profiles it for use in
   applications that support SASL or GSS-API, adding features such as
   key agreement, mutual authentication, and fast re-authentication.

   The following diagram illustrates the interactions between the three
   parties in the GSS BrowserID protocol.  Note that the terms client,
   initiator and user agent (UA) are used interchangeably in this
   document, as are server, acceptor and relying party (RP).

1.1.  Discovery and Negotiation

   The means of discovering GSS-API peers and their supported mechanisms
   is out of this specification's scope.  They may use SASL [RFC4422] or
   the Simple and Protected Negotiation mechanism (SPNEGO) [RFC4178].

   Discovery of a BrowserID identity provider (IdP) for a user is
   described in the BrowserID specification.  A domain publishes a
   document containing their public key and URIs for authenticating and
   provisioning users, or pointer to an authority containing such a
   document.

1.2.  Authentication

   The GSS-API protocol involves a client, known as the initiator,
   sending an initial security context token of a chosen GSS-API
   security mechanism to a peer, known as the acceptor.  The two peers
   subsequently exchange, synchronously, as many security context tokens
   as necessary to complete the authentication or fail.  The specific
   number of context tokens exchanged varies by security mechanism: in
   the case of the BrowserID mechanism, it is typically two (i.e. a
   single round trip), however it can be more in some cases.  Once

Internet-Draft          BrowserID SASL & GSS-API              April 2013


   authentication is complete, the initiator and acceptor share a
   security context which identifies the peers and can optionally be
   used for integrity or confidentiality protecting subsequent
   application messages.

   The original BrowserID protocol, as defined outside this document,
   specifies a bearer token authentication protocol for web
   applications.  The user agent generates a short-term key pair, the
   public key of which is signed by the user's IdP.  (The user must have
   already authenticated to the IdP; how this is done is not specified
   by BrowserID, but forms-based authentication is common.)  The IdP
   returns a certificate for the user which may be cached by the user's
   browser.  When authenticating to a Relying Party (RP), the browser
   generates an identity assertion containing the RP domain and an
   expiration time.  The user agent signs this and presents both the
   assertion and certificate to the RP.  (The combination of an
   assertion and zero or more certificates is termed a "backed
   assertion".)  The RP fetches the public key for the IdP, validates
   the user's certificate (and those of any intermediate certifying
   parties) and then verifies the assertion.

   The GSS BrowserID protocol extends this by having the RP always send
   back a response to the user agent, which at a minimum provides key
   confirmation (this is needed for some key agreement methods) and
   indicates the lifetime of the established security context.  The key
   confirmation token is also required for mutual authentication, when
   the initiator application requests that feature.

1.3.  Message protection services

   GSS-API provides a number of a message protection services:

   GSS_Wrap()  integrity and optional confidentiality for a message

   GSS_GetMIC()  integrity for a message sent separately

   GSS_Pseudo_random()  shared key derivation (e.g., for keying external
      confidentiality+integrity layers)

   These services may be used with security contexts that have a shared
   session key, to protect application-layer messages.

3.  Naming

   The GSS-API provides a rich security principal naming model.  At its
   most basic the query forms of names consist of a user-entered/
   displayable string and a "name-type".  Name-types are constants with
   names prefixed with "GSS_C_NT_" in the GSS-API.  Names may also have
   attributes [RFC6680].

3.1.  GSS name types

3.1.1.  GSS_C_NT_BROWSERID_PRINCIPAL

   This name may contain an e-mail address, or a service principal name
   identifying an acceptor.  The encoding of service principal names is
   intended to be somewhat compatible with the Kerberos [RFC4120]
   security protocol (without the realm name).

   The following ABNF defines the 'name' rule that names of this type
   must match.

   [[anchor1: Should we reference RFC2822 here?  The Mozilla BrowserID
   docs sure don't.]]

       char-normal = %x00-2E/%x30-3F/%x41-5B/%x5D-FF
       char-escaped = "\" %x2F / "\" %x40 / "\" %x5C
       name-char = char-normal / char-escaped
       name-string = 1*name-char
       user = name-string
       domain = name-string
       email = user "@" domain
       service-name = name-string
       service-host = name-string
       service-specific = name-string
       service-specifics = service-specific 0*("/" service-specifics)
       spn = service-name ["/" service-host [ "/" service-specifics]]
       name = email / spn

3.1.2.  GSS_C_NT_USER_NAME

   This name is implicitly converted to a GSS_C_NT_BROWSERID_PRINCIPAL.
   A default domain may be appended when importing names of this type.

3.1.3.  GSS_C_NT_HOSTBASED_SERVICE

   This name is transformed by replacing the "@" symbol with a "/", and
   then implicitly converted to a GSS_C_NT_BROWSERID_PRINCIPAL.

Internet-Draft          BrowserID SASL & GSS-API              April 2013


3.1.4.  GSS_C_NT_DOMAINBASED_SERVICE

   [RFC5178] domain-based service names are transformed into a
   GSS_C_NT_BROWSERID_PRINCIPAL as follows:

   o  the <service> name becomes the first component of the BrowserID
      principal name (service-name in ABNF)

   o  the <hostname> becomes the second component (service-host)

   o  the <domain> name becomes the third component (service-specific)

3.1.5.  GSS_C_NT_ANONYMOUS

   If the initiator principal's leaf certificate does not contain a
   "principal" claim, then the initiator name has this name type.

3.2.  Audience encoding

   A GSS-API service name is encoded into a BrowserID audience URL with
   the following syntax, where spn is defined above:

                         audience = "urn:x-gss:" spn

   [[anchor2: Can we request assignment of a URN?]]

3.3.  Name canonicalization

   The BrowserID GSS-API mechanism performs no name canonicalization.
   The mechanism's GSS_Canonicalize_name() returns an MN whose display
   form is the same as the query form.  Of course, the principal named
   obtained from a CREDENTIAL HANDLE may be canonical in that the IdP
   might only issue credentials for canonical names, but credential
   acquisition is out of scope here.

3.4.  Exported name token format

   The exported name token format for the BrowserID GSS-API mechanism is
   the same as the query form, plus the standard exported name token
   format header mandated by the GSS-API [RFC2743].

   [[anchor3: Do we wish to say anything about the exported composite
   name token format?  It should be an encoding of the initiator's leaf

3.5.  Naming extensions

   The acceptor MAY surface attributes from the assertion and any
   certificates using GSS_Get_name_attribute() (see [RFC6680]).  The URN
   prefix is "urn:<TBD>:params:gss:jwt".  If a SAML assertion is present
   in the "saml" parameter of the leaf certificate, it may be surfaced
   using the URN prefix "urn:<TBD>:params:gss:federated-saml-attribute".

   Attributes from the assertion MUST be marked as unauthenticated
   unless otherwise validated by the acceptor (e.g. the audience).

   Attributes from certificates SHOULD be marked as authenticated.

4.  Context tokens

   All context tokens include a two-byte token identifier followed by a
   backed BrowserID assertion.  This document defines the following
   token IDs:

         +---------+----------+-------+--------------------------+
         | Section | Token ID | ASCII |        Description       |
         +---------+----------+-------+--------------------------+
         |  4.1.1  |  0x632C  |   c,  |  Initiator context token |
         |         |          |       |                          |
         |  4.1.2  |  0x432C  |   C,  |  Acceptor context token  |
         |         |          |       |                          |
         |         |  0x442C  |   D,  |  Context deletion token  |
         |         |          |       |                          |
         |  4.2.4  |  0x6D2C  |   m,  | Initiator metadata token |
         |         |          |       |                          |
         |  4.2.4  |  0x4D2C  |   M,  |  Acceptor metadata token |
         +---------+----------+-------+--------------------------+

   The token ID has a human-readable ASCII encoding for the benefit of
   pure SASL implementations of this mechanism.

4.1.  Base protocol

4.1.1.  Initial context token

   The initial context token is framed per Section 1 of [RFC2743]:

                GSS-API DEFINITIONS ::=
                    BEGIN

                    MechType ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER
                    -- representing BrowserID mechanism
                    GSSAPI-Token ::=
                    [APPLICATION 0] IMPLICIT SEQUENCE {
                        thisMech MechType,
                        innerToken ANY DEFINED BY thisMech
                            -- token ID and backed assertion
                    }
                    END

   Unlike many other GSS-API mechanisms such as Kerberos, this token
   framing is not used by subsequent context or [I-D.zhu-negoex]
   metadata tokens.  As such, pure SASL implementations of this
   mechanism do not need to deal with DER encoding the mechanism object
   identifier.

   GSS BrowserID is a family of mechanisms, where the last element in
   the OID arc indicates the [RFC4121] encryption type supported for
   message protection services.  The OID prefix is
   1.3.6.1.4.1.5322.24.1.  The NULL encryption type is valid, in which
   case key confirmation and message protection services are not
   provided.

   The innerToken consists of the initiator context token ID
   concatenated with a backed assertion for the audience corresponding
   to the target name passed into GSS_Init_sec_context().  In addition,
   the assertion MAY contain the additional claims, which are described
   later in this document:

   o  ECDH key agreement parameters (see Section 6.1.5)

   o  Channel binding information (see Section 6.1.6)

   o  A nonce for binding the request to a response signed with a
      private key for mutual authentication (see Section 6.1.7)

   o  A ticket identifier for fast re-authentication using an
      established session key rather than a BrowserID certificate (see
      Section 6.1.8)

   The call to GSS_Init_sec_context() returns GSS_C_CONTINUE_NEEDED to
   indicate that a subsequent context token from the acceptor is
   expected.

4.1.2.  Acceptor context token

   Upon receiving a context token from the initiator, the acceptor
   validates that the token is well formed and contains a valid
   BrowserID mechanism OID and the initiator context token ID.

   The acceptor then verifies the backed identity assertion per the
   BrowserID specification.  This includes validating the expiry times,
   audience, certificate chain, and assertion signature.  The acceptor
   then verifies the channel binding token, if present, and any other
   GSS-specific claims in the assertion.  In case of failure, a response
   assertion containing GSS major and minor status codes SHOULD be
   returned.

   If the [RFC3961] encryption type for the selected mechanism is not
   ENCTYPE_NULL, the acceptor generates a ECDH public key using the
   parameters received from the client (see Section 6.2.2), and from it
   derives the RP Response Key (RRK) (see Section 7.3).  The acceptor
   then generates a response assertion containing its ECDH public key
   and context expiration time (note that the context expiration time is



Howard & Williams       Expires October 17, 2013               [Page 12]

Internet-Draft          BrowserID SASL & GSS-API              April 2013


   a purely informational quantity).  The response assertion will be:

   o  signed in the acceptor's private key, if mutual authentication was
      requested, and the acceptor has a key (see Section 4.2);

   o  signed in the RRK, if the encryption type for the selected
      mechanism is not ENCTYPE_NULL;

   o  not signed in all other cases.

   The response assertion is encoded as a backed assertion, prefixed
   with the acceptor context token ID.  It SHALL have a certificate
   count of zero.

   Finally, the Context Root Key (CRK) (see Section 7.4) is derived from
   the ECDH shared secret (if present) and GSS_S_COMPLETE is returned,
   along with the initiator name from the verified assertion.  If the
   CRK is available, the replay_det_state (GSS_C_REPLAY_FLAG),
   sequence_state (GSS_C_SEQUENCE_FLAG), conf_avail (GSS_C_CONF_FLAG)
   and integ_avail (GSS_C_INTEG_FLAG) security context flags are set to
   TRUE.

   Other assertion/certificate properties MAY be made available via
   GSS_Get_name_attribute().

4.1.3.  Initiator context completion

   Upon receiving the acceptor context token, the initiator unpacks the
   response assertion and, if applicable, computes the ECDH shared
   secret and RRK.  The RRK is used to verify the response assertion
   unless mutual authentication is available, in which case the
   acceptor's public key will be used.

   The initiator sets the context expiry time with that received in the
   response assertion, if present; otherwise, the context expires when
   the initiator principal's certificate expires.

   The CRK is derived from the ECDH shared secret and GSS_S_COMPLETE is
   returned to indicate the initiator is authenticated and the context
   is ready for use.  No output token is emitted.  Security context
   flags are set as for the acceptor context.

4.2.  Mutual authentication

   Mutual authentication allows the acceptor to be authenticated to the
   initiator.  The mechanism SHALL set the mutual_state security context
   flag (GSS_C_MUTUAL_FLAG) to TRUE if mutual authentication succeeded.
   Support for mutual authentication is OPTIONAL.

Internet-Draft          BrowserID SASL & GSS-API              April 2013


   The base protocol is extended as follows to support this:

4.2.1.  Initiator mutual authentication context token

   If the initiator requested the mutual_state flag, a nonce (see
   Section 6.1.7) is included in the assertion to bind the initiator and
   acceptor tokens.  The presence of a nonce in a certificate-signed
   assertion indicates that mutual authentication is desired.

4.2.2.  Acceptor mutual authentication context token

   If the acceptor has a private key and certificate available and
   received a nonce in the initiator assertion, it signs the response
   using a private key rather than the RP Response Key (RRK).  The
   response includes the nonce from the initiator's assertion, to bind
   the two.

   While the response is a backed assertion, in order to take advantage
   of existing keying infrastructures BrowserID certificates MUST NOT be
   included in the backed assertion.  Rather, an X.509 certificate SHALL
   be included as a value for the "x5c" header property in the assertion
   (see [I-D.ietf-jose-json-web-signature] 4.1.6).  The certificate MUST
   be valid for signing.

   [[anchor4: We don't want to burden the initiator with having to
   implement both methods of authenticating acceptors, and given that
   initiators and acceptors both will generally need a PKIX
   implementation, and given that acceptors will need a PKIX credential
   for TLS, and that there is as yet no standard protocol for automatic
   provisioning of BrowserID credentials for servers, using PKIX to
   authenticate the server seems to be the easiest way to go.]]

4.2.3.  Initiator mutual authentication context completion

   The initiator verifies the assertion signature and that the nonce
   matches, and validates the certificate chain.  Trust anchors SHOULD
   be configurable both system-wide and specifically for the BrowserID
   mechanism.

   If the initiator policy requires the acceptor service name to be
   validated in addition to the acceptor host name, the service name
   MUST be validated against one of the following:

   o  A service-name EKU from the registry defined by [I-D.zhu-pku2u]

   o  An algorithmically mapped service-name EKU (TBD)





Howard & Williams       Expires October 17, 2013               [Page 14]

Internet-Draft          BrowserID SASL & GSS-API              April 2013


   o  A spn expressed as a realm-less KRB5PrincipalName in the id-
      pkinit-san otherName SAN (see [RFC4556] Section 3.2.2)

   o  A BrowserID audience URN containing the spn, encoded in the URI
      SAN (see Section 3.2)

   o  An out-of-band binding to the certificate

   [[anchor5: We need to limit to one or two of these approaches.]]

   If the initiator policy only requires the acceptor host name to be
   authenticated, or an EKU binding is used (rather than an otherName or
   URI SAN containing the host name), then the host component of the
   service name (service-host) MUST be present as a value for the
   dNSName subjectAltName (SAN) or as the least significant Common Name
   RDN.

   If the acceptor name contains a service-specific component and the
   initiator policy requires this to be authenticated, then only the id-
   pkinit-san or audience URN SAN provide this binding.

4.2.4.  Acceptor certificate advertisement

   [I-D.zhu-negoex] may be used to advertise acceptor certificates.

   If the acceptor supports mutual authentication, it MAY include its
   certificate and any additional certificates inside a backed assertion
   with an empty payload as output for GSS_Query_meta_data().  The
   "assertion" is prefixed with the two byte token identifier "M,".

   Upon receiving this, the initiator MAY validate the certificate or
   fingerprint, or present either to the initiator before committing to
   authenticate.

   The NegoEx signing key is the output of GSS_Pseudo_random() (see
   Section 7.7) with an input of GSS_C_PRF_KEY_FULL and "gss-browserid-
   negoex-initiator" or "gss-browserid-negoex-acceptor" (without
   quotes), depending on the party generating the signature.

   The NegoEx authentication scheme is the binary encoding of the
   following hexadecimal string:

   535538008647F5BC624BD8076949F0

   where the third byte (zero above) is set to the [RFC3961] encryption
   type for the selected mechanism.  The authentication scheme for
   encryption types greater than 255 is not specified here.

   There is currently no initiator-sent metadata defined and acceptors
   should ignore any sent.  The metadata is advisory and the initiator
   is free to ignore it.

   [[anchor6: We should have a way for to suppress this when the
   initiator is performing re-authentication]]

4.3.  Fast re-authentication

   Fast re-authentication allows a security context to be established
   using a secret key derived from the initial certificate-signed ECDH
   key agreement.

   The re-authentication assertion is signed with a HMAC using the
   Authenticator Root Key (ARK) (see Section 7.5), rather than a
   initiator principal's BrowserID certificate.

   Support for fast re-authentication is OPTIONAL and is indicated by
   the acceptor returning a ticket in the response assertion.

4.3.1.  Ticket generation

   If the acceptor supports re-authentication, the following steps are
   added to Section 4.1.2:

   1.  A unique, opaque ticket identifier is generated.

   2.  The acceptor creates a JSON object containing the ticket
       identifier and expiry time and returns it in the response to the
       initiator (see Section 6.2.5).

   The acceptor must be able to use the ticket identifier to securely
   retrieve the subject, issuer, audience, expiry time, ARK and any
   other relevant properties of the original security context.  One
   implementation choice may be to use the ticket identifier as a key
   into a dictionary containing this information.  Another would be to
   encrypt this information in a long-term secret only known to the
   acceptor and encode the resulting cipher-text in the opaque ticket
   identifier.

   The ticket expiry time by default SHOULD match the initiator's
   certificate expiry, however it MAY be configurable so the ticket
   expires before or after the certificate.

   The initiator MAY cache tickets, along with the ARK, received from
   the acceptor in order to re-authenticate to it at a future time.

Internet-Draft          BrowserID SASL & GSS-API              April 2013


4.3.2.  Initiator re-authentication context token

   The initiator looks in its ticket cache for an unexpired ticket for
   the desired acceptor.  If none is found, the normal certificate-based
   authentication flow is performed, otherwise:

   1.  The initiator generates a re-authentication assertion containing:
       the name of the acceptor (see Section 6.1.1), an expiry time (see
       Section 6.1.2) and/or the current time (see Section 6.1.3),
       optional channel binding information (see Section 6.1.6), a
       random nonce (see Section 6.1.7), and the ticket identifier (see
       Section 6.1.8).

   2.  The initiator signs the re-authentication assertion with the ARK,
       using the hash algorithm associated with the original context key
       (see Section 10.1; HS256 is specified for the encryption types
       referenced in this document).

   3.  The re-authentication assertion is packed into a backed
       assertion.  The certificate count is zero as the assertion is
       signed with an established symmetric key.

   4.  The initiator generates an Authenticator Session Key (ASK) (see
       Section 7.6) which is used to verify the response and derive the
       CRK.

   [[anchor7: Question: do we want an option to do an ECDH session key
   exchange in the fast re-auth case?  If we had a GSS req_flag for
   requesting perfect forward security (PFS) then we would want to have
   this option.]]

4.3.3.  Acceptor re-authentication context token

   1.  The acceptor unpacks the re-authentication assertion and
       retrieves the ARK, ticket expiry time, mutual authentication
       state and any other properties (such as the initiator name)
       associated with the ticket identifier.

   2.  The acceptor validates that the ticket and re-authentication
       assertion have not expired.

   3.  The acceptor verifies the assertion using the ARK.

   4.  The acceptor generates the ASK (see Section 7.6) and derives the
       RRK and CRK from this (see Section 7.3 and Section 7.4,
       respectively).

Internet-Draft          BrowserID SASL & GSS-API              April 2013


   5.  The acceptor generates a response and signs and returns it.  Note
       that, unlike the certificate-based mutual authentication case,
       the nonce need not be echoed back as the ASK (and thus the RRK)
       is cryptographically bound to the nonce.

   If the ticket cannot be found, or the authentication fails, the
   acceptor SHOULD return a REAUTH_FAILED error, permitting the
   initiator to recover and fallback to generating a BrowserID
   assertion.  It MAY also include its local timestamp (see
   Section 6.2.1) so that the initiator can perform clock skew
   compensation.

4.3.4.  Interaction with mutual authentication

   The mutual authentication state of a re-authenticated context is
   transitive.  The initiator MUST NOT set the mutual_state flag for a
   re-authenticated context unless the original context was mutually
   authenticated.

   As such, the initiator's ticket cache must store the mutual
   authentication state of the original context.

4.3.5.  Ticket renewal

   Normally, re-authentication tickets are only issued when the
   initiator authenticated with a certificate-signed assertion.
   Acceptors MAY issue a new ticket with an expiry beyond the ticket
   lifetime when the initiator used a re-authentication assertion.  The
   issuing of new tickets MUST be subject to a policy that prevents them
   from being renewed indefinitely.

4.4.  Extra round-trip (XRT) option

   The extra round-trip (XRT) option adds an additional round trip to
   the context token exchange.  It allows the initiator to prove
   knowledge of the Context Master Key (CMK) (see Section 7.2) by
   sending an additional token signed in a key derived from the CMK and
   an acceptor-issued challenge.  Support for the XRT option is OPTIONAL
   in the acceptor and REQUIRED in the initiator.  The initiator is
   allowed to not request it, but MUST perform XRT if the acceptor
   requires it.

   (Note that the term "extra round trip" is something of a misnomer; it
   only adds an additional token to the context token exchange.  It is
   anticipated however that this mechanism will most commonly be used
   with pseudo-mechanisms or application protocols that require an even
   number of tokens.)

Internet-Draft          BrowserID SASL & GSS-API              April 2013


4.4.1.  Initiator XRT advertisement

   The initiator may advertise to the acceptor that it supports the XRT
   option by sending in its request assertion an "opts" claim (see
   Section 6.1.9) containing the "xrt" value.  This option MUST be set
   if the caller requested GSS_C_DCE_STYLE (see [RFC4757]).  Otherwise,
   the setting of this option is implementation dependent.

4.4.2.  Acceptor XRT advertisement

   If the initiator requested the XRT option and the acceptor supports
   it, or the acceptor requires it, the acceptor sends a "jti" claim
   (see Section 6.2.6) in the response assertion containing a random
   base 64 URL encoded value.  This value MUST be at least 64 bits in
   length.  The acceptor then returns GSS_C_CONTINUE_NEEDED to indicate
   that an additional context token is expected from the initiator.

   (Note that this top-level "jti" claim is unrelated to the "nonce"
   claim or to the "jti" ticket identifier claim.)

4.4.3.  Initiator XRT context token

   If the acceptor indicated support for the XRT option by including a
   "jti" claim in its response, then the initiator sends an additional
   context token to the acceptor.  This token contains the initiator
   context token ID concatenated with a backed assertion with zero
   certificates and an empty payload, signed using the XRTK (see
   Section 7.6.1).

4.4.4.  Acceptor XRT context token validation

   The acceptor MUST validate the XRT context token by first validating
   the context token ID, and then verifying the assertion signature with
   the XRTK.  The acceptor SHOULD reject XRT context tokens with a
   certificate count greater than zero.  Unknown claims in the assertion
   payload MUST be ignored.  The acceptor then returns GSS_C_COMPLETE to
   the caller.

   The acceptor MAY avoid using a replay cache when this option is in
   effect.

4.4.5.  Interaction with message protection services

   When the XRT option is in effect, the XRTK is used instead of the CMK
   to derive the Context Root Key (CRK) (see Section 7.4).  Per-message
   tokens MUST have the AcceptorSubkey flag set (see [RFC4121] Section
   4.2.2).

5.  Validation

5.1.  Expiry times

   The expiry and, if present, issued-at and not-before times of all
   elements in a backed assertion, MUST be validated.  This applies
   equally to re-authentication assertions, public key assertions, and
   the entire certificate chain.  If the expiry time is absent, the
   issued-at time MUST be present, and the JWT implicitly expires a
   short, implementation-defined interval after the issued-at time.  (A
   suggested interval is five minutes.)

   The GSS context lifetime SHOULD NOT exceed the lifetime of the
   initiator principal's certificate.

   The lifetime of a re-authentication ticket SHOULD NOT exceed the
   lifetime of the initiator principal's certificate.  The acceptor MUST
   validate the ticket expiry time when performing re-authentication.

   Message protections services such as GSS_Wrap() SHOULD be available
   beyond the GSS context lifetime for maximum application
   compatibility.

5.2.  Audience

   If the credential passed to GSS_Accept_sec_context() is not for
   GSS_C_NO_NAME, then its string representation as a BrowserID
   principal MUST match the unencoded audience (that is, the audience
   without the URN prefix defined in Section 3.2).

5.3.  Channel bindings

   GSS-API channel binding is a protected facility for naming an
   enclosing channel between the initiator and acceptor.  If the
   acceptor passed in channel bindings to GSS_Accept_sec_context(), the
   assertion MUST contain a matching channel binding claim.  (Only the
   application_data component is validated.)

   The acceptor SHOULD accept any channel binding provided by the
   initiator if NULL channel bindings are passed to
   GSS_Accept_sec_context().

5.4.  Key agreement

   The initiator MUST choose an ECDH curve with an equivalent strength
   to the negotiated [RFC4121] encryption type.  Appropriate curves are
   given in Section 10.1.




Howard & Williams       Expires October 17, 2013               [Page 20]

Internet-Draft          BrowserID SASL & GSS-API              April 2013


   The curve strength MUST be verified by the acceptor.  A stronger than
   required curve MAY be selected by the initiator.

5.5.  Signatures

   Signature validation on assertions is the same as for the web usage
   of BrowserID, with the addition that response assertions may and re-
   authentication assertions must be signed with a symmetric key.  In
   this case the HMAC algorithm associated with the mechanism OID is
   used, and there are no certificates in the backed assertion.

5.6.  Replay detection

   If the XRT option is not in effect, the acceptor SHOULD maintain a
   cache of received assertions in order to guard against replay
   attacks.

5.7.  Return flags

   The initiator and acceptor should set the returned flags as follows:

   deleg_state  never set

   mutual_state  set if the initiator requested mutual authentication
      and mutual authentication succeeded

   replay_det_state  set if message protection services are available

   sequence_state  set if message protection services are available

   anon_state  set if the initiator principal's leaf certificate lacks a
      "principal" claim

   trans_state  set if the implementation supports importing and
      exporting of security contexts

   prot_ready_state  may be set when or after the RP Response Token is
      produced or consumed

   conf_avail  set if message protection services are available

   integ_avail  set if message protection services are available

6.1.  Request (initiator/UA) assertion

   These claims are included in the assertion sent to the acceptor and
   are authenticated by the initiator's private key and certificate
   chain (directly, or in the case of re-authentication assertions,
   transitively).  Claims not specified here MUST be ignored by the
   acceptor.

   Here is an example assertion containing Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman
   parameters, along with a nonce indicating that mutual authentication
   is desired:

         {
             "exp": 1360158396188,
             "ecdh": {
                 "crv": "P-256",
                 "x": "JR5UPDgMLFPZwOGaKKSF24658tB1DccM1_oHPbCHeZg",
                 "y": "S45Esx_6DfE5-xdB3X7sIIJ16MwO0Y_RiDc-i5ZTLQ8"
             },
             "nonce": "GnK2IBA42iQ",
             "aud": "urn:x-gss:imap/mail.example.com"
         }

   The following claims are permitted in the request assertion:

6.1.1.  "aud" (Audience)

   The audience, formatted as a URN containing the acceptor's principal
   name (see Section 3.2).  This claim is REQUIRED.

   [[anchor8: Note that if the initiator application specified a
   target_name of GSS_C_NO_NAME then we could omit this (although this
   may not be permitted by the base protocol).  If the initiator wanted
   mutual authentication then we could find out the acceptor's name and
   provide it via GSS_Inquire_context().  This is only really useful and
   secure with mechanisms like this one where the initiator credential
   is based on a public/private key pair and either we use key agreement
   and per-message tokens or channel binding to a secure channel.  This
   really should [have] be[en] explained in RFC2743.]]

6.1.2.  "exp" (Expiry time)

   This contains the time when the assertion expires, in milliseconds
   since January 1, 1970.  At least one of "exp" or "iat" MUST be
   present.

6.1.3.  "iat" (Issued at time)

   This contains the time the assertion was issued (in milliseconds
   since January 1, 1970).  If present, the acceptor MUST validate that
   the assertion was recently issued.  At least one of "exp" or "iat"
   MUST be present.

6.1.4.  "nbf" (Not before time)

   This contains the time, in milliseconds since January 1, 1970, from
   which the assertion begins to be valid.  This claim is OPTIONAL.

6.1.5.  "ecdh" (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman key agreement)

   These contain ECDH key parameters for deriving a shared session key
   with the relying party: "crv" contains the curve, "x" the X
   coordinate and "y" the Y coordinate (see
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-json-web-token] Section 5.2).

   The "ecdh" claim is REQUIRED unless the associated encryption type is
   ENCTYPE_NULL, or there is already a prior session key (as is the case
   for re-authentication assertions).

6.1.6.  "cb" (Channel binding)

   This contains channel binding information for binding the GSS context
   to an outer channel (e.g. see [RFC5929]).  Its value is the base64
   URL encoding of the application-specific data component of the
   channel bindings passed to GSS_Init_sec_context() or
   GSS_Accept_sec_context().  This claim is OPTIONAL.

6.1.7.  "nonce" (Mutual authentication nonce)

   This is a random quantity of at least 64 bits, base 64 URL encoded,
   which is used to bind the request and response assertions in the case
   a freshly agreed key is not used to sign the response assertion.
   This claim is REQUIRED if mutual authentication is desired and the
   assertion is signed using a certificate, or if re-authentication is
   being performed.

6.1.8.  "tkt" (Ticket identifier)

   This is an opaque ticket identifier, when the assertion is being used
   for fast re-authentication.  This matches the "jti" value sent back
   in the response assertion ticket.  This claim is REQUIRED for re-
   authentication assertions, otherwise it the assertion MUST be
   rejected.

6.1.9.  "opts" (Options)

   This contains a JSON array of string values indicating various
   protocol options that are supported by the initiator.  Unknown
   options MUST be ignored by the acceptor.  This document defines the
   following extensions:

   +------+------------------------------------------------------------+
   | Name |                         Description                        |
   +------+------------------------------------------------------------+
   |  xrt |   The initiator supports the extra round trip option (see  |
   |      |                        Section 4.4)                        |
   |      |                                                            |
   |  dce |    The initiator requested GSS_C_DCE_STYLE (see RFC4757    |
   |      |                        Section 7.1)                        |
   |      |                                                            |
   |  ify |  The initiator requested GSS_C_IDENTIFY_FLAG (see RFC4757  |
   |      |                        Section 7.1)                        |
   +------+------------------------------------------------------------+

6.2.  Response (acceptor/RP) assertion

   The response assertion is sent from the acceptor to the initiator to
   provide key agreement, and either key confirmation or mutual
   authentication.  It is formatted as a backed assertion, however in
   the current specification it consists of a single assertion with zero
   certificates; that is, it is "unbacked".  (It is encoded as a backed
   assertion in order to provide future support for mutual
   authentication using native BrowserID certificates.  Such support is
   not specified here; implementations of this version of the
   specification SHOULD reject response assertions with BrowserID
   certificates.)

   In the case of a key successfully being negotiated, the response
   assertion is signed with the RP Response Key (RRK) (see Section 7.3).
   Alternatively, it may be signed with the acceptor's private RSA or
   DSA key.  In this case, the acceptor's X.509 certificate is included
   in the "x5c" property of the JWT header.

   The HMAC-SHA256 (HS256) algorithm MUST be supported by implementors
   of this specification.

   If a key is unavailable, then the signature is absent and the value
   of the "alg" header claim is "none".  No signature verification is
   required in this case, however the initiator MUST then return an
   error unless the [RFC3961] encryption type for the mechanism is
   ENCTYPE_NULL.

   Claims not specified here MUST be ignored by the initiator.

   Here is an example response assertion:

       {
           "exp": 1362960258000,
           "nonce": "bbqT10Gyx3s",
           "ecdh": {
               "x": "bvNF6V1rpMeQyGOKCj0kBaOaSh3tlhUcbffaji4uCEI",
               "y": "Iuqs650FXzXFUD9kHknETfbqiB8XBbCHlJXoysx3rvw"
           },
           "tkt": {
               "jti": "Jgg7vKX2sEKlCWBfmLTg_n4qz3NVZxOU-a2B4qYMkXI",
               "exp": 1362992660000
           }
       }

   The following claims are permitted in the response assertion:

6.2.1.  "iat" (Issued at time)

   The current acceptor time, in milliseconds since January 1, 1970.
   This allows the initiator to compensate for clock differences when
   generating assertions.  This claim is OPTIONAL.

6.2.2.  "ecdh" (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman key agreement)

   This contains a JSON object containing the coordinates of the
   acceptor's ECDH public key: "x" contains the X coordinate and "y" the
   Y coordinate (see [I-D.ietf-oauth-json-web-token] Section 5.2).  This
   claim is REQUIRED unless the associated encryption type is
   ENCTYPE_NULL, or there is already an established session key, as is
   the case for re-authentication assertions.

   The "crv" property MUST NOT be present; it is determined by the
   initiator.

6.2.3.  "exp" (Expiry time)

   This contains the time when the context expires, in milliseconds
   since January 1, 1970.  This claim is OPTIONAL; the initiator should
   use the certificate or ticket expiry time if absent.

6.2.4.  "nonce" (Mutual authentication nonce)

   The nonce as received from the initiator.  This MUST NOT be present
   unless a nonce was received from the initiator, and the acceptor is
   signing the assertion with a private key.

6.2.5.  "tkt" (Ticket)

   This contains a JSON object that may be used for re-authenticating to
   the acceptor without acquiring an assertion.  Its usage is optional.
   It has two properties: "jti", an opaque identifier to be presented in
   a re-authentication assertion; and "exp", the expiry time of the
   ticket.  This claim is OPTIONAL.

6.2.6.  "jti" (JWT ID)

   This contains a base64 URL encoded random value of at least 64 bits
   that is used to uniquely identify the acceptor response, in the case
   that the extra round trip option is used.  It SHOULD not be present
   unless the initiator requested the extra round trip option.

6.3.  Error (acceptor/RP) assertion

   Error assertions are backed assertions containing any or all of the
   following claims.  In addition, they MUST have the "iat" claim, for
   initiator clock skew correction.  All other response assertion claims
   are OPTIONAL or not applicable in error assertions.  Conversely, the
   claims listed below MUST NOT be present in a non-error response
   assertion.

6.3.1.  "gss-maj" (GSS major status code)

   This contains a GSS major status code represented as a number.

6.3.2.  "gss-min" (GSS minor status code)

   This contains a GSS minor status code represented as a number.

   If REAUTH_FAILED is received, the initiator SHOULD attempt to send
   another initial context token containing a fresh assertion.

   The following protocol minor status codes are defined.  Note that the
   API representation of these status codes is implementation dependent.
   Status codes with the high bit set are GSS BrowserID protocol errors;
   the remainder are BrowserID protocol errors.

6.4.  XRT assertion

   No claims are presently defined for the extra round trip assertion.
   Unknown claims MUST be ignored by the acceptor.

7.  Key derivation

   The following function is used as the base algorithm for deriving
   keys:

   browserid-derive-key(K, usage) = HMAC(K, "BrowserID" || K || usage ||
   0x01)

   The HMAC hash algorithm for all currently specified key lengths is
   SHA-256.  Note that the inclusion of K in the HMAC input is for
   interoperability with some crypto implementations.

7.1.  Diffie-Hellman Key (DHK)

   This key is the shared secret resulting from the ECDH exchange.  Its
   length corresponds to the selected EC curve.  It is never used
   without derivation and thus may be used with implementations that do
   not expose the ECDH value directly.

7.2.  Context Master Key (CMK)

   This is the Diffie-Hellman Key (DHK) for all initially authenticated
   contexts and the Authenticator Session Key (ASK) for re-authenticated
   contexts.

7.3.  RP Response Key (RRK)

   If mutual authentication without a fast re-authentication ticket is
   performed then the response assertion will be signed with a public
   key signature using the private key for the acceptor's certificate.

   Otherwise a symmetric RP Response Key (RRK) is derived as follows:

   RRK = browserid-derive-key(CMK, "RRK")

7.4.  Context Root Key (CRK)

   The Context Root Key (CRK) is used for [RFC4121] message protection
   services, e.g.  GSS_Wrap() and GSS_Get_MIC().  If the extra round-
   trip option is in effect, it is derived as follows:

   CRK = random-to-key(browserid-derive-key(XRTK, "CRK"))

   Otherwise, the CMK is used:

   CRK = random-to-key(browserid-derive-key(CMK, "CRK"))

   The random-to-key function is defined in [RFC3961].

7.5.  Authenticator Root Key (ARK)

   The Authenticator Root Key (ARK) is used to sign assertions used for
   fast re-authentication.  (The term "authenticator" is equivalent to
   "re-authentication assertion" and exists for historical reasons.)  It
   is derived as follows:

   ARK = browserid-derive-key(CMK, "ARK")

7.6.  Authenticator Session Key (ASK)

   The Authenticator Session Key (ASK) is used instead of the DHK for
   re-authenticated contexts.  It is derived as follows:

   ASK = browserid-derive-key(ARK, nonce-binary)

   The usage (nonce-binary) is the base64 URL decoding of the initiator
   "nonce" claim.

7.6.1.  Extra Round Trip Key (XRTK)

   The Extra Round Trip Key (XRTK) is used to sign the extra round trip
   token, and also as the master key for the CRK when the extra round
   trip option is used.

   XRTK = browserid-derive-key(CMK, acceptor-jti-binary)

   The usage (acceptor-jti-binary) is the base64 URL decoding of the
   acceptor "jti" claim.

7.7.  GSS Pseudo-Random Function (PRF)

   The BrowserID mechanism shares the same Pseudo-Random Function (PRF)
   as the Kerberos GSS mechanism, defined in [RFC4402].
   GSS_C_PRF_KEY_FULL and GSS_C_PRF_KEY_PARTIAL are equivalent.  The
   protocol key to be used for GSS_Pseudo_random() SHALL by the Context
   Root Key (CRK).

   [[anchor9: Can we replace this with a function that imports less of
   RFC3962?  We arguably should, because otherwise the only things we
   import from RFC3962 (and 3961) are random-to-key (the identity
   function in RFC3962) and the crypto bits needed for RFC4121 per-
   message tokens.]]

8.  Example

   Suppose a mail user agent for the principal lukeh@lukktone.com wishes
   to authenticate to an IMAP server rand.mit.de.padl.com.  They do not
   have a re-authentication ticket.  The mail user agent would display a
   dialog box in which the principal would sign in to their IdP and
   request a fresh assertion be generated.

   The initial "n,," is the GS2 header (indicating that there are no
   channel bindings).  The "c," denotes the token as being a BrowserID
   initial context token.  The remaining base64 URL encoded data is a
   BrowserID backed assertion, containing the following certificate (for
   clarity, the payload has been reformatted and JWT header and
   signature omitted):

9.  Security Considerations

   This document defines a GSS-API security mechanism, and therefore
   deals in security and has security considerations text embedded
   throughout.  This section only addresses security considerations
   associated with the BrowserID GSS mechanism described in this
   document.  It does not address security considerations associated
   with the BrowserID protocol or the GSS-API themselves.

   This mechanism provides for authentication of initiator principals
   using private keys to public key crypto-systems, using the BrowserID
   specification for user certificates (which are NOT PKIX [RFC5280]
   certificates).  Authentication of the acceptor principal is optional.
   Fast re-authentication is supported via acceptor-issued fast re-
   authentication tickets.

   All cryptography for per-message tokens is imported from the Kerberos
   GSS-API mechanism [RFC4121].

   This mechanism actually has several mechanism OIDs, composed of a
   prefix identifying this family of mechanisms followed by an arc
   identifying the [RFC3961] encryption type for use with per-message
   tokens and the GSS_Pseudo_random() function.  The NULL encryption
   type is supported, and when it is used then the GSS-API per-message
   tokens and GSS_Pseudo_random() function are not available, but
   channel binding and mutual authentication may be available.  Also,
   when using the NULL encryption type the fast re-authentication
   feature is not available because key exchange is only performed the
   initiator application uses the variant of this mechanism that
   supports per-message tokens and the GSS_Pseudo_random() function.

   Acceptor credentials are PKIX [RFC5280] certificates and their
   private keys.

9.1.  Host certificates for mutual authentication

   Allowing a match on only the DNS subjectAltName in an acceptor's
   X.509 certificate permits different services on the same host to
   impersonate each other.  This should be subject to local policy.

9.2.  Error statuses

   Returning rich error information in the clear (see Section 6.3.2) may
   leak information.  Implementations may squash status codes and/or
   avoid returning minor statuses entirely.  Indeed, applications may
   even not send back error tokens at all, instead closing the
   connection or whatever might be appropriate for the application.
   (This is a generic GSS-API security consideration.)

10.2.  SASL Registry

   Subject: Registration of SASL mechanisms BROWSERID-AES128 and
   BROWSERID-AES128-PLUS

   SASL mechanism names: BROWSERID-AES128 and BROWSERID-AES128-PLUS

   Security considerations: See RFC 5801 and draft-howard-gss-browserid

   Published specification (recommended): draft-howard-gss-browserid

   Intended usage: common

   Owner/Change controller: iesg@ietf.org

   Note: This mechanism describes the GSS BrowserID mechanism used with
   the aes128-cts-hmac-sha1-96 encryption type.  The GSS-API OID for
   this mechanism is 1.3.6.1.4.1.5322.24.1.17.  As described in RFC 5801
   a PLUS variant of this mechanism is also required.

   [[anchor11: We could use the NULL encryption type variant for SASL,
   as the GS2 bridge does not use message protection services.  However,
   because that mechanisms is unkeyed, re-authentication would not be
   available.  Defining a single AES128 mechanism is consistent with GSS
   EAP.]]
